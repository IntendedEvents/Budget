This tool is meant to help you **start the conversation** around your wedding budget — not to be a precise quote.

It uses estimated ranges based on real weddings and vendor averages across Vancouver Island, but actual prices may vary depending on season, style, and location.

Take this as your planning launchpad, not your final spreadsheet 🌛
